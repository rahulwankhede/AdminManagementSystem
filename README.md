# AdminManagementSystem
## Group 3 Project

- The Admin Management System (AMS) is a full-stack application that provides functionalities for a bank administrator to manage customers, branches, and customer accounts. 
- The AMS has been developed using robust technologies like Spring Boot, JPA, and Hibernate for the backend functionality, MySQL for the database, and ReactJs for front-end implementation.
- REST APIs are implemented using Hibernate to interact with the database. ReactJs then uses these APIs to query the database and fetch the data that it uses in its components. It provides an interactive and user-friendly interface.
- Unit testing has been implemented using JUnit to test the REST APIs.
